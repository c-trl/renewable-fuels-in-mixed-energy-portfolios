# Renewable Energy, Deregulation, and Residential Electricity Prices

<p>The first regression analysis I ever carried out was for a Seminar in Applied Economics at Rutgers.  I was (and still am) intrigued by the energy industry - from the international economics to implications on auxiliary industries and markets - I love eating up anything energy-related</p>

<p>For the first iteration of this analysis, I used Stata and Excel.  This was way before I took General Assembly's Data Science course and got into data analysis with Python.  This project was fairly simple - present a simple regression (via PowerPoint no less).  I decided to use a reduced form equation for the regression since variables I dealt with were both supply-side and demand-side.  My findings drove me to become even more curious about the industry: I could see the effects of deregulation and varying fuel costs clearly in the regression results.</p>

This repository will contain a re-construction of this study.  Instead of Stata and Excel, I will attempt a more intimate approach with Python (namely, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib).
